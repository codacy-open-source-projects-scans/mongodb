## What are Dev Containers?

Dev Containers provide a consistent, reproducible development environment using Docker containers. This ensures:

- ‚úÖ **Consistency**: Everyone works with identical tooling and dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Isolation**: Your host system stays clean
- ‚úÖ **Portability**: Develop from any machine with Docker
- ‚úÖ **Quick Setup**: Get started in minutes, not hours

## Benefits for MongoDB Development

The MongoDB devcontainer provides:

1. **Pre-configured Build Environment**: All build tools, compilers, and dependencies ready to use
2. **MongoDB Toolchain**: Specific GCC/Clang versions required for building MongoDB
3. **IDE Integration**: VS Code settings optimized for C++, Python, JavaScript, and Bazel
4. **Persistent Caching**: Build artifacts and Python environments preserved across sessions
5. **EngFlow Support**: Built-in support for remote execution and caching

## System Requirements

- **Docker**: Allocate as much RAM as possible to Docker (leave ~4-8 GB for host OS)
- **CPU**: Allocate as many cores as possible to Docker (leave 1-2 for host OS)
- **Disk Space**: 60+ GB recommended for container, tools, and build artifacts
- **VS Code**: Latest version with Remote - Containers extension
- **Operating System**:
  - macOS (ARM64 or x86_64)
  - Windows 10/11 with WSL2
  - Linux (x86_64 or ARM64)

## Getting Help

- **Documentation Issues**: Open an issue or PR in the MongoDB repository
- **Devcontainer Problems**: Check [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md)
