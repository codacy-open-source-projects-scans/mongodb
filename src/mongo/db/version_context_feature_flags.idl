    featureFlagReplicateOFCVInOplog:
        description: >
            Enabled when all binaries support replicating the OFCV (versionContext) in the oplog.
            Snapshotting of OFCV for sharded operations is controlled by featureFlagSnapshotFCVInDDLCoordinators.

            (Enable on transitional FCV): Necessary to ensure that operations using OFCV have a
            stable view of all feature flags with a version greater or equal than this feature flag.
            See SERVER-102084 for more detail.
            If this feature flag is disabled by a FCV downgrade, all operations with an operation FCV
            are drained when finalizing the downgrade.
